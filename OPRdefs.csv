Our model proposes a fully-transparent PR process, whereby reviews by referees are posted online and tagged to the article in question. This allows the implementation of a reviewer evaluation system that will provide motivation for potential reviewers [18]. Referee efforts will be acknowledged and rewarded, thus enhancing their academic standing in the field. Such a mechanism will also help to solve the ??difficult to find reviewers?? and ??time limitation of the reviewers?? problems mentioned by L. Egghe. In our system, writing a good review could be scientifically as beneficial as contributing an original article. Furthermore, open PR will sidestep other serious concerns too, such as reviewers evaluating papers outside their area of expertise, or writing a positive review as a favour, since their review will be subject to open criticism from the scientific community.
 While L. Egghe holds that PR is guided by deontological rules, this is something that is not transparent in a blind PR system. On the contrary, open PR creates a public environment where everyone can judge and where every judgment can be weighted. The NSAP model turns what constitutes a weakness for classical journals into a strength for science and society. In the open environment we advocate, a large scientific community can assess the quality of a manuscript, or even discover frauds or sources of plagiarism a lot more efficiently than is possible today by two or three anonymous and unmotivated reviewers.... The open PR system presents the author with the opportunity to address the problem of visibility by being the driving force seeking reviewers and reviews, which will likely also increase article citation rates. /",1,1,1,1,1,0

A new class of users is created, the ?editors?. Each editor works for an electronic journal. Authors, after having uploaded a preprint to the archive, may elect to submit their article for review and official publication in one of these electronic journals. An editor of that journal then decides whether the article is appropriate for the journal in terms of scope and quality. If it is not, this decision is publicly attached to the article and the process ends; if it is, the editor invites one or more referees to write public reviews, to be attached to the article. The article author may subsequently post a public rebuttal to the reviews. Based on the referee reports and rebuttals, the editor decides whether to accept, demand changes to, or reject the article. The original article, reviews, rebuttal and publication decision are published in perpetuity. If accepted, the author posts a final version of the article to arXiv.org; as a peer reviewed and officially published article, it is visibly set apart from mere preprints and added to the electronic journal?s collection of published articles. Rejected articles may be submitted to another electronic journal. Reviews should be signed with the referee?s full name and affiliation. This maximizes transparency and allows referees to receive academic credit for their work.... It will also be desirable to attach a moderated discussion forum to each article, as a natural gathering place of interested researchers. The quality of these forums would serve as a criterion to differentiate electronic journals from each other.",1,1,1,1,1,1

We invited 14 outside experts to write commentaries on the Makridakis competition. Of these, eight agreed and seven completed their papers. The commentators are all from different organizations. Three are practitioners and four are academicians. We asked these commentators to address any aspect of the original paper. They were given approximately five months to write their commentary. We reviewed each commentary and made suggestions for change (sometimes with more than one round of revisions). Later, the commentators were provided with papers by the other commentators and were given a further opportunity for revisions. Finally, the commentators and authors were provided with edited versions of all papers and were given an opportunity to clarify their own papers and to suggest clarifications in other papers.

The submission is uploaded to the journal?s server and everyone can have a look at it. In the case of revisions (along the path from the original submission to the final published text) the interim steps are also visible. In addition, the editor does not select referees, but opens a general, open debate about the manuscript. Self-appointed referees (Sumner and Shum 1997) comment on the merits of the paper online. In general, both the author?s and the public referees? identities are not disguised. While there are good arguments in favour of anonymity, the primary argument against it is that it seems wrong for somebody to make an important judgement on the work of others in secret (Smith 1999). Although, in principle, the technology allows for anonymity, it is not implemented because it would not suit well the otherwise open character of the procedure. The philosophy behind open peer review is basically that it is expected that the more people participate in the review process, the better the result. An open, non-anonymous procedure would be more ??democratic??, less determined by a single editor or a small board. In addition, the author is not only at the receiving end of a decision already taken, but in a position to participate in the review process through interactive means. While reviewing in the traditional model is a solitary activity, the open communicative process may lead to a discourse in which the ideas are refined and shaped.? (Nentwich 2005, 183)",,1,1,1,1,1,0

Since this open peer-review model would be based around pre-published material on the web, it would generally lead to shorter publications than traditional publishing. Articles that work well for open peer review tend to be shorter, much more targeted, and have a much shorter bibliography than traditional articles, even when they represent the same level of research quality. Lastly, just as authors would need to be more comfortable sharing ideas that may not be camera-ready, reviewers need to be more comfortable sharing their comments, including critical ones, on the open web for such a project to work. Blind peer review protects reviewers as much as authors. Open peer review may be a non-starter for those used to providing their comments anonymously.? (Shaffer 2014, 1)",,1,1,1,1,1,0

Of course, the latter is only a ?downside? if this is not a desired outcome of openness. Ultimately, open review communities must determine the types and degrees of openness they will pursue in relation to the desired outcomes of the peer review process.

 ? the lack of blinding of the reviewer's identity. There can be several variants of this: the reviewers' names can be made known to the author (that is, the reports are signed) but are not made public (as at the BMJ, the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine and BioMed Central medical journals), or alternatively the reviewers' names can be made public and attached to the published paper. It is also possible for the reviewers to remain anonymous during the process of review but for their names subsequently to be revealed and published alongside the paper. Another variant is to allow the author to nominate the referees (as at Biology Direct).
 ? access to the reviewer's reports and the associated author responses and other documentation. The review process can take place in the open, with the submitted manuscript, reviewer reports, author responses and editor's comments etc. made available in real time; this is the approach adopted at the journal Atmospheric Chemistry & Physics. Alternatively, the reviewing documents can be published simultaneously with the paper (e.g. as at The EMBO Journal ). An additional requirement can be that the reviewer does not provide confidential comments to the editor in addition to the report that is made available to the author.
 ? the pool of people able to comment on the submitted manuscripts, i.e. opening this up to the wider community rather than relying on two or three reviewers selected by the editor. This approach can take place after publication (see Post-publication peer review, below) or prior to publication (as at Atmospheric Chemistry & Physics or at the Nature peer review trial). The intended reviewer pool can be the wider research community (perhaps including regions under-represented among reviewers), statisticians or other professionals, or even patients as proposed at the Journal of Participatory Medicine (Shashok 2010).?

 In recent years, scientists have increasingly called for an Open alternative to traditional peer review. This has manifested in journals adopting Open Peer Review (OPR), researchers taking to their blogs to review already-published work, and the proliferation of Open and Post-publication Peer Review sites like Faculty of 1000, PubPeer, and Publons.
 
 Each shade of OPR has its advantages and disadvantages. Let?s take a closer look.
 
 Open Peer Review for journals
 Here?s how Open Peer Reviews work, more or less: reviewers are assigned to a paper, and they know the author?s identity. They review the paper and sign their name. The reviews are then submitted to the editor and author (who now knows their reviewers? identities, thanks to the signed reviews). When the paper is published, the signed reviews are published alongside it.
 
 Journals including BMJ and PeerJ require or allow Open Peer Reviews.
 
 Participating in journal-based OPR can be a good way to experiment with OPR as it?s officially sanctioned by the author, journal, and reviewer alike.
 
 One drawback to this type of Open Peer Review is that journals sometimes do not provide permanent identifiers for the reviews themselves, making it difficult to track the reach and impact of your review rather than for the journal article you?ve reviewed. Luckily, PeerJ is working to change that?they?re now issuing DOIs for Open peer reviews, which comprise 40% of their reviews.
 
 Third-party Open and Post-publication Peer Review sites
 In the past few years, a number of standalone, independent peer review sites have emerged: PubPeer, Publons, and Faculty of 1000 are among the many. These sites allow you to review both published and under-review papers on their platform, and in the case of Publons, export your reviews to journals for use.
 
 These sites also allow you to submit your reviews as Open Peer Reviews, and to create profiles showcasing your peer reviews. Some sites like Publons also issue DOIs for reviews, making them citable research objects.
 
 Blogging as Open Post-publication Peer Review
 In this type of Open Peer Review, academics take to their blogs to share their thoughts on a recently published paper or preprint. These reviews can run the gamut from highly-technical reviews oriented towards other scientists (a good example is this post on Rosie Redfield?s blog) to reviews written for a more general audience (like Mike Eisen?s post on the same study).
 
 A major advantage to blogging your Open Peer Reviews is that you don?t have to have permission to do it; you can just fire up your blog and start reviewing. But a downside is that the review isn?t formally sanctioned by the journal, and so can carry less weight than formal reviews.
 
 No matter what type of Open Peer Review you opt for, if it?s got your name attached to it and is available for all to read, you can use it to showcase your expertise in your area of research.",,1,1,0,1,1,1
